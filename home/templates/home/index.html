            There are many articles dealing with this topic however I have found that these articles tend be more for the experienced programmer
            and can be hard to grasp for people like myself who new to programming.</br></br>
            This article will break down the coding process into small parts which can easily be digested so we can understand the important concepts
            involved in the coding process.

            Data needs to be stored! But how? A tree data structure! Just like a tree is made of a root connected to branches and leaves a tree data structure has nodes with a key pair values. 
            Each node represents a location having a unique name(key) and a value. The value can be list, string or even a dictionary. Each node can be connected to a node of even a series or nodes with links just like a tree branch is 
            connected to leaves.</br></br>

            </br>

            The root node is the main node from which all links and node will branch out from. There are many types of tree data structure, for simplicity
            the article will deal with a general tree structure which means a node can be linked to many nodes compared to for example a binary tree where nodes 
            are limited to two connections.

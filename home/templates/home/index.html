        <div class="article ps-5 pe-5 w-75 mx-auto">This article's objective is to simply explain the algorithm used to finding all possible routes within a network. </br></br>
            There are many articles dealing with this topic however I have found that these articles tend be more for the experienced programmer
            and can be hard to grasp for people like myself who are relatively new to programming.</br></br>
            This article will break down the coding process into small parts which can easily be digested so we can understand the core concepts
            involved in the coding process.

        <div class="col-12 h2 text-primary text-center mt-5">How Data is stored</div>
        <div class="article ps-5 pe-5 w-75 mx-auto">
            Data needs to be stored! But how? A tree data structure! Just like a tree is made of a root connected to branches and leaves a tree data structure has nodes with a key pair values. 
            Each node represents a location having a unique name (key) and a value. The value can be list, string or even a dictionary. Each node can be connected to a node of even a series or nodes with links (edges) just like a tree branch is 
            connected to leaves.</br></br>
            <div class="text-center tree"><img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}tree-1.png" alt="data tree structure" /></div>
            </br>
            The root node is the main node from which all links and node will branch out from. There are many types of tree data structure, for simplicity
            the article will deal with a general tree structure which means a node can be linked to many nodes compared to for example a binary tree where nodes 
            are limited to two connections.
        </div></br>
        <div class="text-center binary-tree"><img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}binary-tree.png" alt="data tree structure" /></div>
        <div class="col-12 h2 text-primary text-center mt-5">Why Tree's?</div>
        <div class="article ps-5 pe-5 w-75 mx-auto">
            Trees are mainly used for searching and sorting as they provide a convenient means to store data hierarchically. In our case we are more 
            interested in the searching aspect, more specifically the breadth first traversal method which we will come to later.</br></br>
            Searching through a tree to find a specific node and it corresponding value in a structured form is of high importance and has several practical uses
            in programming from file searching, finding routes in a road network and even solving a maze. The algorithm which will be used will focus on finding all routes for a specific node which we 
            will further refine to obtain shortest routes between 2 nodes. I guess at this point its isnt that hard to realise the practical use of 
            such an algorithm! Who wouldn't want to travel from A to B in the shortest time unless its not the cheapest way! (Which will get to eventually).
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 h2 text-primary text-center mt-5">Lets Talk Recursion</div>
        <div class="article ps-5 pe-5 w-75 mx-auto">
            One important concept while traversing nodes is recursion. Recursion is a programming technique using function or algorithm that calls itself one or more times until a
            specified condition is met. Recursion gives us the ability to search our tree using the same function until all nodes have been explored thus greatly facilitating our task 
            since we no longer need to write multiple functions to find nodes.</br></br>
            
            In simple terms we call our functions again, again and again until we not longer need it. A simple illustration of recursion would be the following code:</br></br>
                    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                    <div class="ps-2 p-1 code-text bg-dark text-light fw-bold">def recursive_function(num):</br>&emsp;
                        if num == 0:<span class="text-success">&emsp;#Stopping condition</span></br>&emsp;&emsp;
                            return print('The End!')</br>&emsp;                  
                            print(num)</br>&emsp;
                            recursive_function(num-1)</br>
                    
                        recursive_function(5)<span class="text-success">&emsp;#Call to our function</span></br></br>

                        Output:</br>
                        5</br>4</br>3</br>2</br>1</br>"The End!"</br>
                        
                    </div>
                </div></br>
            The call to our function will continue as long as the stopping condition hasnt been met, in this case num==0.                    
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 h2 text-primary text-center mt-5">Let Define our Steps</div>
        <div class="article ps-5 pe-5 w-75 mx-auto">
            First we start by defining our problem from which we can define a solution.<br><br>
            <span class="fw-bold">Problem:</span>&emsp;Obtain all routes for a network.<br></br>
            Starting with an initial simple test case ensures that code works with minimum data before moving on to larger data and making
            debugging more manageable, hence we will start with the following graph (network) represented by a dictionary:<br></br>
            <div class="ps-2 code-text text-dark fw-bold">
                graph = {"A": ["B", "C"], "B": ["A", "D"], "C": ["A"]}
            </div></br></br>
            The following graph can be represented on a diagram as follows:
            <div class="text-center binary-tree"><img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}graph.png" alt="data tree structure" /></div></br>
            Since the graph is simple we can expect the output of the our program to be as follows, representing all routes starting from node "A":</br></br>
            <div class="ps-2 code-text text-dark fw-bold">
                OUTPUT: [["A", "B", "D"], ["A", "C"]]
            </div></br></br>
            <span class="fw-bold">Our Solution:</span><br></br>
            <div class="ps-2">
            1. Starting at the initial node "A" we find all connecting nodes.</br>
            <div class="text-center binary-tree"><img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}connecting1.png" alt="data tree structure" /></div></br>
            2. Add the routes from step 1 to a stack. which will be the starting node plus the connecting node.</br></br>
            <div class="ps-2 code-text text-dark fw-bold">
                stack = [["A", "B"], ["A", "C"]]
            </div></br>
            3. The items in the stack our sent back into our functions (recursion!) one by one to check if there are no connecting nodes for the last added node whilst also
            checking if the node hasnt been visited before.</br></br>
            <div class="ps-2 code-text text-dark fw-bold">
                function(["A", "B"], <span class="text-danger">"B"</span>) , function(["A", "C"], <span class="text-danger">"C"</span>)
            </div></br>
            <div class="text-center binary-tree"><img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}connecting2.png" alt="data tree structure" /></div></br>
            4. If step 3 returns no connecting nodes, therefore implying the stack is empty, we can assume that we have reached the end of our route and we can add that route to a list.</br></br>
            <div class="ps-2 code-text text-dark fw-bold">
                function(["A", "C"], <span class="text-danger">"C"</span>) stack empty
            </div></br>
            <div class="ps-5">We add ["A", "C"] to a list</div></br>
            5. If step 3 yields connecting nodes we add the route back to the stack to be sent back to our function until no connecting nodes are obtained.</br></br>
            <div class="ps-2 code-text text-dark fw-bold">
                stack = [["A", "B" ,"D"]]</br></br>
                function(["A", "B" ,"D"], <span class="text-danger">"D"</span>)</span>)
            </div></br>
            <div class="ps-2 code-text text-dark fw-bold">
                function(["A", "B", "D"], <span class="text-danger">"D"</span>) stack empty
            </div></br>
            <div class="ps-2 code-text text-dark fw-bold">
                stack = []</br>
            </div></br>
            <div class="ps-5">We add ["A", "B", "D"] to a list</div></br>
            6. Once no connecting nodes are obtained from the stack, the stack remains empty, we return the list of all routes.</br></br>
            <div class="ps-2 code-text text-dark fw-bold">
                all_routes = [["A", "B", "D"], ["A", "C"]]
            </div></br>
            This method of searching for connecting nodes level by level and is referred to as <span class="fw-bold">breadth first traversal method</span>. 
        </div>        
        </div></br></br>
        <div class="col-12 h2 text-primary text-center">Let's Start Coding!</div>
        <div class="article ps-5 pe-5 w-75 mx-auto">Our code will be written in Python and will consist of 2 functions:</br></br>
            1. The Start function which will take the initial inputs and send it to our recursive function and will also return our final result. We also require a globally defined variable to store all routes when stacks return empty list as described above.</br>
            <div class="ps-2 code-text text-dark fw-bold mt-3">
                all_routes = []</br></br>
                def find_routes(graph, vertex, visited=[]):</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;visited.append(vertex)</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;paths = find_connections(graph, vertex, visite>d)</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;return print(f'final result: {paths}')</br>
            </div></br>
            2. The recursive function which will be the heart of our algorithm to search through our tree.</br>
            <div class="ps-2 code-text text-dark fw-bold mt-3">
                def find_path(graph, vertex, visited):</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;stack = []</br></br>
                &emsp;&emsp;<span class="text-primary">print(f'Check connections: {visited , vertex}')</span></br></br>
                &emsp;&emsp;for node in graph[vertex]:</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;if node not in visited:</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;stack.append(visited + [node])</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;if stack:</br></br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="text-primary">print(f'stack: {stack}')</span></br></br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for route in stack:</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;find_connections(graph, route[-1], route)</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;else:</br></br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="text-primary">print(f'No Connections!, stack:{stack}'))</span></br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="text-primary">print(f'Add to all routes: {visited}')</span></br></br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;all_routes.append(visited)</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;return all_routes
            </div></br>
            Print statements have been included to help us follow our code,  let's run out code using our previously defined graph:</br>
            <div class="ps-2 code-text text-dark fw-bold mt-3">
                &emsp;&emsp;Run: print(f'All Paths: {find_routes(graph, "A")}')</br></br>
                &emsp;&emsp;OUTPUT:</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Check connections: (['A'], 'A')</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;stack: [['A', 'B'], ['A', 'C']]</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Check connections: (['A', 'B'], 'B')</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;stack: [['A', 'B', 'D']]</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Check connections: (['A', 'B', 'D'], 'D')</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;No Connections!, stack:[]</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Add to all routes: ['A', 'B', 'D']</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Check connections: (['A', 'C'], 'C')</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;No Connections!, stack:[]</br>

            </div></br>
            Output as predicted!

        <div class="col-12 h2 text-primary text-center mt-2">More Test Cases!</div>
        <div class="article ps-5 pe-5 w-75 mx-auto">
            Now we know our code is working as expected its time to increase the pressure and run a slightly more complex test case!
            The graph we will use is as follows:
